    Named key pairs are another way of provisioning the authorized_keys of an agent. They are available on AWS-EC2, OpenStack and CloudStack and are typically defined outside of jenkins using your cloud's GUI. Here, you can enter the name of the key pair to be used. The username they are associated with, depends on the image that has been launched.
