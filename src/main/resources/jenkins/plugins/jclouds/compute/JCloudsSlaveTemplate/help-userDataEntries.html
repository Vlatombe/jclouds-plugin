    User data is used for configuring/augmenting the provisioning process of a new VM instance by the cloud provider.
    In the simplest case, this is just another shell script. However, many cloud providers provide images with
    pre-configured <b>cloud-init</b>. This tool can do a lot more in an easier way. It even allows multipart
    config data which is why you can add multiple snippets here. Please be aware, that some providers limit the
    total amount of data. Please read the
    <a href="http://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html">cloud-init documentation</a> and ask your provider
    about those limits.<br/>
    Also note: <b>If</b> using multipart data, we enforce <b>merging</b> of multiple <b>yaml</b> snippets. More info
    about this feature
    <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/JClouds+Plugin#JCloudsPlugin-MergedcloudinitYAMLdefinitions">here</a>.
    Finally, with some providers (like Rackspace for example), you must also enable the config drive option further below in
    order to take advantage of this feature.
