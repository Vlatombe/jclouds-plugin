    Normally, if a node has multiple IP addresses, Jenkins selects the first public address and if there are no public addresses, the first
    private address. This fits 99% of all use cases. If your network setup is more complex, then you can specify an <b>address/prefix</b> here.
    If this matches one of the node's addresses, the first matching address is chosen for connecting via ssh. Otherwise (or if you keep this field
    empty), Jenkins falls back to its original selection.
