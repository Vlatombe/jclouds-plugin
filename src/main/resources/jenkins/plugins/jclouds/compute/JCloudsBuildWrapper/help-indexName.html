    Specify  the name of an index variable that will be published in the metadata of the supplemental nodes.
    The value of this variable is a zero-based counter of supplemental nodes and helps distinguishing the
    nodes if multiple instances are requested.<p/>
    If this is empty or undefined, then the default "JCLOUDS_SUPPLEMENTAL_INDEX" will be used.<p/>
    This feature is currently implemented for OpenStack und GCE clouds only.
